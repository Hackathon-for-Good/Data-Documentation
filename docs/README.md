# Hacakathon for Good Data Documentation

Hackathon for Good is an open invitation to anyone with a hacker mindset and the passion to work on data and AI for impact. We are curious about the possibilities of new technologies. We want to apply them for good. To solve things that truly matter. All across the world.

Our mission is to connect data and AI savvy innovators with transition leaders to accelerate purpose-driven innovation by governments, NGOs, universities, and businesses. We help them prototype with data and AI. By providing access to data, tools, challenges, team members, training, and mentoring.

Hackathon for Good is organized by The Hague Tech and WorldStartup, in collaboration with the Hagueâ€™s innovation ecosystem consisting of the many innovation hubs and programs in The Hague like Impact City, The Hague Security Delta, The Hague Humanity Hub and YES!Delft.

Hackathon for Good started in The Hague with the mission to connect AI and Data to the world of Humanitarian Development and Aid. After two successful editions by the Data Science Initiative we slightly broadened our scope with more topics, more partners, and the first international editions.
