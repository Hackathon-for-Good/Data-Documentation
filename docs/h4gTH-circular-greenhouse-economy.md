# Challenge

How can we encourage <ins>(greenhouse) growers</ins> to get insights and be involved in the relation between their production and their local environmentsâ€™ biodiversity by making local data easy to access and understand at all times and especially when they are having to adapt to modern requirements and possibilities instead of only relying on their own personal data and knowledge?

## An impressive feat 

There are more than 13,000 greenhouses in the Netherlands covering close to 131 million m2. This powers the agricultural production of the nation with limited land capabilities. But any 
exceptional feat might come with drawbacks, and balancing the harm to benefit would be key to long term sustainability. 

## Can you identify the relation between greenhouses, water quality and biodiversity?
