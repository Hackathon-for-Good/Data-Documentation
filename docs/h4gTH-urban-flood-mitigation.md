# Challenge

How ​can ​we ​help ​<ins>city planners and engineers</ins> to design/adapt urban infrastructure for the protection of a city area from flooding as well as for a quick recovery process ​by providing a reusable digital model that can be applied by different communities ​when deciding on local flood procedure and sharing information with all local key stakeholders ​instead ​of ​having an unclear intervention for a very specific context and for potential cascading effects within it?



!> You can get access the datasets on November 15th.
